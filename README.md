## About The Client

JitsMob aims to educate the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) community through online video content on topics such as: 
 * Injury prevention 
 * Mobility 
in order to maximise their Performance and give them something to complement what they do in training.

* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JitsMob-1854775828114449/) (389 followers). 

Instagram has the largest amount of followers, however, the platform only allows 1 minute videos, and the client believes that this timeframe does not allow him enough time to communicate his message. Currently, there are links on his Instagram account to his YouTube channel, however the view count (or statistics) on YouTube show that this does not to entice his followers to want to view his content. As such, he's requested a digital product that will help entice his followers on Instagram to go on a centralized platform that will allow the community to want to view his full content.
